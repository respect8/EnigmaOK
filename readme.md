# Purpose of repository

### The project is pointed to people who want to learn something new and hone their own developer skills.

We're going to leverage:

- Java knowledge

- design patterns

- enhance testing skills

- develop skills to work with a team, especially with git-tool


What we'll do during this project

- implementation few fancy algorithms

    - Cesar [go there][cesar_page]

    - ROT-13 [go there][rot13_page]

    - Vigenere [take me there][vigenere_page]

    - Matrix [let's go][matrix_page]

    - AtBash [nice, WTF?][AtBash_page]

- introduce design patterns, exp:

    - singleton

    - factory

    - strategy 

- add third part extention
    
    - iText, [see sample][itext]

    - apache email [how to send an email][email]

    - give to your user ability to save massage in a pdf file or send it in an email, or send the pdf in an email.  Deploy it in your GUI app.

- simple window do manage our ciphers and makes it more useful for an operator

- extend application and add manage of users

    - supply machanizm to change user

    - add in Option menu new feature :  
            own settings  
            own path to store coded phrases  
            prefered cipher  
            default email  
            etc
- save own setting in formats:

    - JSON

    - properties 

    - XML (option)

    - CSV (option)

- supply strategy pattern to run export to specific destination format

## ___This guideline will be updated every day during the whole learning block according to contestants' progress___

## Game rule

1. Everyone makes a fork of this repository
    - you have to make a new branch and  name of it is your name
    - this is simple way to follow your progress

2. You make own implementation of a given task

3. Every algorithm has necessary test methods

4. After implementation make push request to _master_ to due check result by teacher 



# Happy coding !!!
